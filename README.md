## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript Functionalities
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned

Working on this project, I learnt about and worked with Regular Expressions(RegEx) as well as different form validations. I also learnt more about the different input types and the features of the different CSS transform and position properties.


### Continued development

In the future, when I learn more about APIs, I may be back to this project to add the Stripe API, in order to integrate card payments. 

### Useful resources

- [Isocroft's Credit Card Numbers RegEx](https://gist.github.com/isocroft/072ea5e1f4d0d52eb034e7a6c93b5b76) - This helped me in getting Regular Expressions for the different Credit Card companies.
- [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/) - BlackBox's AI was useful in correcting wrong regular expressions and strengthening the form input validations.
